Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist.

Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist.

Part::take: Cannot take positions 1 through 4 in {}[[1,1]].

Set::shape: Lists {J$2103, K$2103, Γ$2103, h$2103} and {}[[1,1]][[1 ;; 4]] are not the same shape.
J=J$2103; K=K$2103; G=Γ$2103; L=41; h=(0.0001,0,0); 

Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist.

General::stop: Further output of Part::partw will be suppressed during this calculation.

FindFile::string: String expected at position 1 in FindFile[toPath[{}[[1,1]], 41, 8, free, 705]].

OpenRead::fstr: File specification toPath[{}[[1,1]], 41, 8, free, 705] is not a string of one or more characters.

ReadList::stream: OpenRead[toPath[{}[[1,1]], 41, 8, free, 705]] is not a string, SocketObject, InputStream[ ], or OutputStream[ ].

Close::stream: OpenRead[toPath[{}[[1,1]], 41, 8, free, 705]] is not a string, SocketObject, InputStream[ ], or OutputStream[ ].

Set::shape: Lists {j$2103, L$2103, χ$2103, ω$2103, ξ$2103, {EnList$2103[[1]], EnList$2103[[2]], EnList$2103[[3]], Δseq$2103, Δωseq$2103}} and OpenRead[toPath[{}[[1,1]], 41, 8, free, 705]] are not the same shape.

Part::partd: Part specification h$2103[[1]] is longer than depth of object.

Part::partd: Part specification h$2103[[2]] is longer than depth of object.

Part::partd: Part specification h$2103[[3]] is longer than depth of object.

General::stop: Further output of Part::partd will be suppressed during this calculation.
